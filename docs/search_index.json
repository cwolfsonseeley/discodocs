["what-is-disco.html", "2 What is the Disco Engine? 2.1 Vocabulary and Grammar 2.2 Facilitating discovery", " 2 What is the Disco Engine? If you happen to have an APRA account, this article in APRA Connections magazine is a good introduction. If you don’t have an APRA account, then read on . . . The Discovery Engine, or Disco Engine, is a prospecting tool that empowers Prospect Development staff to precisely define (and pull together) constitutencies for their fundraising clients. It does so by providing two complementary resources: a vocabulary and grammar for specifying constituencies, and tools to facilitate discovery of constituencies. 2.1 Vocabulary and Grammar The Disco Engine is based on the idea that a constituency can be defined using one or more predicates (such as “majored in math” or “attended a Discover Cal event”), where multiple predicates are combined using “and”, “or”, or “but not.” To illustrate, here is a sample constituency definition for the department of mathematics: majored in mathematics or has given to the math department The constituency is then just any individual who fits the definition. The most basic tool that the Disco Engine provides is called a widget, which is a tool for generating a simple predicate. For instance, the widget majored_in allows us to build the first part of our example definition: majored_in(mathematics) Furthermore, the Disco Engine provides the following connectors to combine predicates in order to create more complex definitions: %and% %or% %but_not% So in the language of the Disco Engine, our definition would look like: majored_in(mathematics) %or% gave_to_department(mathematics) There is no limit to the number of predicates that can be strung together to form a definition: majored_in(mathematics) %or% gave_to_department(mathematics) %and% lives_in_msa(san_francisco) These definitions can quickly become very complex. To manage that complexity, the Disco Engine provides the ability to assign names to definitions, that can then be used to construct more complex definitions: is_math_constituent = majored_in(mathematics) %or% gave_to_department(mathematics) local_math_constituent = is_math_constituent %and% lives_in_msa(san_francisco) parent_of_local_math_constituent = parent_of(local_math_constituent) Together, the collection of predicates, the logical operators, and the ability to assign names form an expressive language for describing custom constituencies for a variety of purposes. Best of all, the Disco Engine gives us the ability to pull the IDs of a defined constituency from the database! display(parent_of_local_math_constituent) ## # A tibble: 561 x 1 ## entity_id ## &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 1168 ## 2 4522 ## 3 6322 ## 4 6326 ## 5 7644 ## 6 11512 ## 7 23989 ## 8 24151 ## 9 24247 ## 10 26492 ## # … with 551 more rows 2.2 Facilitating discovery Having a clear language for prospecting and defining constituencies is nice, but Prospect Development is increasingly being asked to do affinity-based prospecting, which often involves defining new constituencies that don’t have clear-cut coding associated with them yet, or digging into student activity, interest, affiliation, and other codes to figure out which ones might fit the constituency to be defined. That need motivates the Disco Engine’s bots, such as the brainstorm bot and the matrix bot. We’ve already seen examples of using predicates to find individuals, but bots allow us to search for predicates. brainstorm_bot(&quot;robot*&quot;, &quot;artificial intelligence&quot;, &quot;AI&quot;) ## attended_event ## 8760: Robots on the Edge:Intelligent Machines ## 9139: AI Energy Alumni Panel &amp; Firm Night ## 8759: Fireside Chat w/Tom Siebel: AI and IoT ## 9141: AI Business Behaving Well: Social Resp. ## 9361: Inclusive AI: Technology and Policy ## 9140: AI Career Coach Information Session ## 6724: Haas East Bay Chp Robotic Event 06-18-14 ## 9325: BARS 2017: Bay Area Robotics Symposium ## 9136: AI Getting Smart about Start-Ups ## 9497: Putting AI to Work: Tech &amp; Policy ## 9498: WIT: Future of AI ## 8761: Silicon Valley Forum: Medical Robotics ## 9147: AI Coaching with Niandong Wang MBA &#39;04 ## 9280: AL SD Content AI Impact on Life ## 9431: SVF: Robots on the Edge ## 9138: AI Learn how to Write a Powerful Resume ## attended_hs ## 471828: Cb-Ai Operations S&amp;L ## fec_gave_to_committee ## C00596908: ROBOTECHNOLOGY INC C.R. ## C00521765: LIQUID ROBOTICS INC POLITICAL ACTION COMMITTEE (LIQUID ROBOTICS PAC) ## C00144261: APPRAISAL INSTITUTE PAC (AI PAC) ## C00717249: RALLY ROBOT ZAPS AOC ## C00582767: CAMPAIGN FOR A FEDERAL ROBOTICS COMMISSION ## C00635748: AI PAC ## C00717074: RALLY ROBOT 2020 ## has_interest ## AIN: Artificial Intelligence ## ROB: Robotics ## participated_in ## UROB: Robotmedia Presents ## RENY: Robotics &amp; Engineering for Youth ## ENRO: Cal Robotics ## sec_filed ## 1409269: Restoration Robotics, Inc. ## 1528557: Corindus Vascular Robotics, Inc. ## 1409269: Restoration Robotics Inc "],

["installation.html", "4 Installation 4.1 Before you continue 4.2 A disco test", " 4 Installation Discoveryengine (and all packages we use in Prospect Developmemt) is installed on the R drive. The most important step to make sure you can access these packages is to set up your default library path to the shared packages repository. Run a quick test to see your current library path: .libPaths() The first result returned shoud be “R:/Prospect Development/Prospect Analysis/pd-shared-r-packages”. If it’s not, follow the steps below to change your default library path. Step 1: Open a new RStudio session and run the following script: # the first part sets up the new package directory package_dir &lt;- &quot;R:/Prospect Development/Prospect Analysis/pd-shared-r-packages&quot; if (!dir.exists(package_dir)) dir.create(package_dir, recursive = TRUE) # then make a configuration file that notifies R of the new package directory # change [username] to your actual username in your P drive - usually LastNameFirstInitial env_file &lt;- &quot;P:/[username]/.Renviron&quot; if (!file.exists(env_file)) file.create(env_file) # and add the new location to the configuration file cat(&quot;\\nR_LIBS_USER=&#39;&quot;, package_dir, &quot;&#39;&quot;, sep = &quot;&quot;, file = env_file, append = TRUE) Step 2: Find the newly created .Renviron file. It will be in your P drive. Step 3: Move the .Renviron file to your Documents folder. This should be located in D:\\Users\\[username]\\Documents. Simply drag and drop. Step 4: Quit your current RStudio session and open a new one. Try running the following test again: .libPaths() If the PD shared packages depository is returned, you are ready to start using Disco Engine. If not, contact the Analytics Team to troubleshoot your situation. 4.1 Before you continue At this point, you should have already: - tested your CDW connection - installed getcdw - run a test query If you haven’t completed all of those items, head over to section Test CDW and complete those steps, and then return here. 4.2 A disco test In order to make sure everything is working properly, we’ll run a quick disco test: # you&#39;ll always load the discoveryengine package before doing anythying else library(discoveryengine) # make sure we can create a disco definition high_cap = has_capacity(1) # make sure that things print properly high_cap ## LISTBUILDER DEFINITION (type: entity_id) ## . source: d_entity_mv.entity_id (entity_id) ## . logic: capacity_rating_code IN (1) # make sure we can send the defintion to the data warehouse display(high_cap) ## # A tibble: 298 x 1 ## entity_id ## &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 1969 ## 2 3105 ## 3 3422 ## 4 7011 ## 5 7644 ## 6 12178 ## 7 12453 ## 8 17464 ## 9 18139 ## 10 20125 ## # … with 288 more rows If you got this far without any problems, then congrats!

["intro-example.html", "5 An introductory example 5.1 Develop a strategy 5.2 Create the definition 5.3 Send the definition to the CDW", " 5 An introductory example Before diving in to details, let’s work through a simple real-life example. We’ll explain the functions used in more detail in later sections, but here you can see what the tool looks like in action. Here is our scenario: A fundraiser just called, and is trying to organize an event in San Francisco that will feature a well-known technologist. She wants you to help her find prospects to invite to the event. We start out by loading the discoveryengine: library(discoveryengine) 5.1 Develop a strategy You might already be thinking of what sorts of prospects we should look for. That’s good! There are countless ways to respond to this request, and you’ll have to rely on your own expertise in order to know who to include on a potential invite list. For this example, I’ll use the following definition of a good prospect: has demonstrated an interest in technology, and … lives or works in/near San Francisco Note that we now have a pretty clear idea of who to look for, but we need more precision. For instance, what constitutes a “demonstrated interest in technology?” What does it mean to be “in/near San Francisco?” In day-to-day conversations, we don’t necessarily need that level of precision to understand one another, but since we’ll need to translate this request into language a computer can understand, the more precision the better. I’ll define a “demonstrated interest in technology” as having either an interest code or a philanthropic affinity related to technology, and “in/near San Francisco” as anywhere that falls into the San Francisco Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA). 5.2 Create the definition So now that we have a precise idea of who we want to find, we can create a definition that the computer will understand. This is important, since our computer is the only link we have to the CADS Data Warehouse. We can give it a precise definition in a language that it understands, and it will then relay our request to the CADS Data Warehouse. The CADS data warehouse can then search for people who meet our definition, and send them back to the computer, which will then display the list to us. Ideally, our definition would look like this: has_tech_interest %and% is_in_sf. Of course, we haven’t defined those pieces yet, so just typing that in will result in an error has_tech_interest %and% is_in_sf ## Error in operate(block1, block2, &quot;intersect&quot;): object &#39;has_tech_interest&#39; not found But still we’ve made progress. We broke a big problem (“define a prospect for this SF tech event”) into two smaller problems (“define having a tech interest” and “define being in San Francisco”). Let’s tackle each of these one by one. We start by defining has_tech_interest. Recall that we decided to use interest codes and philanthropic affinities here. I happen to already know that there is an interest code for “technology”, but I’m less familiar with the philanthropic affinities area. So I’ll use the search feature that is built into most widgets, accessed by entering a question mark followed by a search term into the widget: has_philanthropic_affinity(?tech) ## Regular codes and synonyms: ## synonym code ## science_technology ST Ah, ok. I can use either the code ST or the synonym science_technology. has_tech_interest = has_interest(technology) %or% has_philanthropic_affinity(science_technology) We use %or% as the connector here because we’re interested in anyone who has either one of these characteristics. We now move to defining is_in_sf. We’d like to look for anyone who lives or works in San Francisco: is_in_sf = lives_in_msa(san_francisco) %or% works_in_msa(san_francisco) We are now able to create our full definition by combining the pieces: event_prospect = has_tech_interest %and% is_in_sf 5.3 Send the definition to the CDW As we discussed in the previous section, now that we have an official definition we can send it to the data warehouse, and see if the data warehouse finds anyone who fits. You can see the definition for yourself by just typing the name of it, though it is now written in a language for the computer to understand and may look intimidating to us humans: event_prospect ## LISTBUILDER DEFINITION (type: entity_id) ## . operator (JQ89): intersect ## . left (JQ89): ## . . operator (PE79): union all ## . . left (PE79): ## . . . source: d_bio_interest_mv.entity_id (entity_id) ## . . . logic: ## . . . . interest_code IN (&#39;TEC&#39;) ## . . . . stop_dt is null ## . . right (PE79): ## . . . source: d_oth_phil_affinity_mv.entity_id (entity_id) ## . . . logic: ## . . . . other_affinity_type IN (&#39;ST&#39;) ## . . . . sum(gift_amt) &gt;= 0.0 ## . right (JQ89): ## . . operator (RI24): union all ## . . left (RI24): ## . . . source: d_bio_address_mv.entity_id (entity_id) ## . . . logic: ## . . . . geo_metro_area_code IN (&#39;41860&#39;) ## . . . . addr_type_code IN (&#39;H&#39;) ## . . . . contact_type_desc IN (&#39;ADDRESS&#39;) ## . . . . addr_status_code IN (&#39;A&#39;, &#39;K&#39;) ## . . right (RI24): ## . . . source: d_bio_address_mv.entity_id (entity_id) ## . . . logic: ## . . . . geo_metro_area_code IN (&#39;41860&#39;) ## . . . . addr_type_code IN (&#39;B&#39;, &#39;I&#39;) ## . . . . contact_type_desc IN (&#39;ADDRESS&#39;) ## . . . . addr_status_code IN (&#39;A&#39;, &#39;K&#39;) In order to send the definition to the data warehouse, retrieve the results, and show them to us, we use the display function: display(event_prospect) ## # A tibble: 1,104 x 1 ## entity_id ## &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 529 ## 2 616 ## 3 3422 ## 4 5280 ## 5 5573 ## 6 5833 ## 7 6622 ## 8 6886 ## 9 7995 ## 10 9783 ## # … with 1,094 more rows Of course, we are probably interested in exporting this savedlist to a file, so that we might load it into CADS and run CADSmart reports on it. Conveniently, we can just do that by adding a filename: display(event_prospect, file = &quot;sf-tech-prospects&quot;) Now when I look over at my working directory, there’s a new file called sf-tech-prospects.csv "],
["working-with-widgets.html", "6 Working with widgets 6.1 Finding widgets 6.2 Leveraging autocomplete 6.3 Codes and synonyms 6.4 Synonym search 6.5 Use the default cases 6.6 The not() operator 6.7 Detailed controls", " 6 Working with widgets So far, we’ve used widgets in some simple examples. In this section, we’ll explore widgets in some more detail. As always, we’ll begin by loading the discoveryengine: library(discoveryengine) 6.1 Finding widgets There are two main ways to find widgets. The first is to use the show_widgets function. The function takes no arguments. When you run it, an interactive list of widgets, with short descriptions of each, will appear in your viewer window: Searching for widgets related to employment data You can browse the entire listing, or use the search bar at the top right to search for specific widgets. The second way to search for widgets is to use the widget_for function. This function takes as an argument a search term, and finds all widgets that are related to that search term. For example: widget_for(&quot;giving&quot;) ## fund_area: ## Find funds with a particular area of giving code (type: allocation_code) ## fund_department: ## Find funds with a particular department code (type: allocation_code) ## fund_miner: ## Entities who gave to funds that match a keyword search (type: entity_id) ## fund_purpose: ## Find funds with a particular fund purpose (type: allocation_code) ## fund_text_contains: ## Funds with notes/biographies that contain the specified search string(s) (type: allocation_code) ## fund_type: ## Find funds with a particular fund type code (type: allocation_code) ## gave_to_area: ## Lists entities who gave to specific areas with minimum giving and specific date range (type: entity_id) ## gave_to_department: ## Lists entities who gave to specific departments with minimum giving and specific date range (type: entity_id) ## gave_to_fund: ## Entities who have given to specified funds (type: entity_id) ## gave_to_fund_type: ## Entities who have given to specific types of funds (type: entity_id) ## gave_to_purpose: ## Find donors to funds with a particular purpose (type: entity_id) ## has_philanthropic_affinity: ## Lists entities with philanthropic affinity(ies) (type: entity_id) ## has_philanthropic_interest: ## Lists entities with philanthropic interest(s) (type: entity_id) Once you’ve found the widget you’re looking for, you can get additional information using R’s built-in help system. Just type a question mark followed by the name of the widget, e.g. ?gave_to_area. 6.2 Leveraging autocomplete As the previous section illustrates, there are a bewildering number of widgets available in the Discovery Engine. To make them a little easier to navigate, we’ve attached standard prefixes to the names of groups of widgets with related functionality. Since RStudio’s autocomplete pops up suggestions along with documnetation as you type, typing a known prefix is a good way to quickly find and access a widget. Autocomplete pop up for giving widgets Here are some of the groups of related widgets that use common prefixes in their names: Giving-related widgets: To find donors to the College of Natural Resources, you’d use gave_to_area. To find donors to scholarships, use gave_to_purpose. Type gave_to and wait for a second to see the full list of giving widgets. Political contribution widgets (federal): Widgets for political contributions in federal elections all begin with the prefix fec_. Political contribution widgets (statewide): Widgets for political contributions in California elections all begin with the prefix ca_. In addition to entity widgets, other types of widgets are also helpfully grouped together. Every widget that pulls allocation codes instead of entity IDs begins with fund_ (for example, fund_type or fund_department). Contact report widgets all begin with contact_ (for example contact_text_contains or contact_date). Proposal-based widgets all begin with proposal_ (for example, proposal_actual_ask or proposal_qualified). Finally, bot_brainstorm and bot_matrix are aliases for the brainstorm_bot and the matrix_bot, and in general, typing bot_ and waiting for a second will show a full list of the disco engine’s bots. 6.3 Codes and synonyms You may have noticed in previous examples that widgets work with exact codes, such as in_unit_portfolio(BU) or with synonyms, such as in_unit_portfolio(business). Synonyms will always be in lower-case, and may include any letter of the alphabet or the underscore \"_\" character, and nothing else. Use whichever feels more comfortable – there is no advantage to using codes vs. synonyms, though I personally find the synonyms easier to read and understand later on. 6.4 Synonym search If you’re not sure of the code or synonym to use, try out the synonym search feature that works with most widgets. Instead of entering a code (in_unit_portfolio(BU)) or synonym (in_unit_portfolio(business)), enter a question mark followed by a search string: in_unit_portfolio(?business) ## Regular codes and synonyms: ## synonym code ## business BU You can enter partial terms: in_unit_portfolio(?sci) ## Regular codes and synonyms: ## synonym code ## greater_good_science_center GG ## qb3_quantitative_biosciences QB ## letters_science LS ## lawrence_hall_of_science LH ## neuroscience_institute NS ## letters_and_science LS ## neuroscience NS ## quantitative_bioscience QB ## quantitative_biosciences QB And even multiple search terms: in_unit_portfolio(?bus, ?chem, ?public) ## Regular codes and synonyms: ## synonym code ## business BU ## chemistry CH ## public_health PH ## public_policy PP ## communications_public_affairs PA Widgets can always accept multiple codes/synonyms as arguments, and even combinations of the two: gave_to_area(business) would find anyone who has given to the school of Business gave_to_area(business, chemistry) would find anyone who has given to Business or to Chemistry gave_to_area(HSB, COC) is the same as above gave_to_area(business, COC) once again, the same thing 6.5 Use the default cases So by now you can probably figure out that partcipated_in(uc_jazz_ensembles) gets you alumni who participated in the UC Jazz Ensembles. But what if you’re actually looking for people who particpated in any student activity at all? Would you have to type out all (hundreds!) of them? Luckily, no! In fact, all you have to do is type participated_in(): did_anything = participated_in() display(did_anything) ## # A tibble: 256,802 x 1 ## entity_id ## &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 3 ## 2 4 ## 3 5 ## 4 7 ## 5 9 ## 6 15 ## 7 16 ## 8 18 ## 9 22 ## 10 28 ## # … with 256,792 more rows That seems a bit magical, doesn’t it? The reason that works is because every widget has a defined behavior for when no codes/synonyms are entered. These default behaviors aim to be sensible so that you can use them in an intuitive way. You can always find out exactly what is included in the default by using the help. For instance, by typing ?has_capacity I find out that entering has_capacity() without any specific ratings will find anyone with a researched capacity rating between 1 and 14 (so 99’s are excluded, and those with no capacity ratings are excluded). 6.6 The not() operator Within a widget, you can use not to modify what you’re looking for. For example, you can type gave_to_fund_type(not(endowment)) to find donors who gave to any kind of fund other than endowment funds. For an example of when this can be useful, see the MBA dual-degree holder example. 6.7 Detailed controls We saw above that gave_to_area(business) will find people who have given to the Haas School of Business. By default, this will find anyone who has ever given any amount, at any time. But gave_to_area, like many widgets, has a number of optional arguments that allow more fine-grained control. For example: gave_to_area(business, at_least = 10000): finds anyone who has given at least $10,000 lifetime to the school of Business. gave_to_area(business, at_least = 10000, from = 20160101): finds anyone who has given at least $10,000 to Business since the beginning of 2016. gave_to_area(business, at_least = 10000, from = 20150101, to = 20151231): finds anyone who gave at least $10,000 to Business between January 1, 2015 and December 31, 2015. gave_to_area(business, from = 20150101, to = 20151231): finds anyone who gave anything at all to the school of Business between January 1, 2015 and December 31, 2015 As you can see, you can pick and choose which optional arguments you want to use. To find out all of the possible controls for a widget, use the built in help. For example, type ?gave_to_area. "],
["combining-widgets.html", "7 Combining widgets 7.1 Example", " 7 Combining widgets As flexible as individual widgets are, they won’t help you too much by themselves. What makes them really useful is that they can be combined. There are three ways to combine widgets: %and% will look for entities who satisfy both widgets %or% will look for entities who satisfy at least one of two widgets %but_not% will look for entities who satisfy a widget but do not satisfy a second widget. Some quick examples: gave_to_area(art_museum) %and% gave_to_area(cal_performances) finds anyone who has given to both the Art Museum and Cal Performances. gave_to_area(art_museum) %or% gave_to_area(cal_performances) finds anyone who has ever given to either the Art Museum or to Cal Performances. Note that this would include everyone who was found in the previous (%and%) example, as well as those who only gave to one or the other area. gave_to_area(art_museum) %but_not% gave_to_area(cal_performances) finds anyone who has given to the Art Museum but has not given to Cal Performances. 7.1 Example You’re working with a major gift officer in the School of Business who is surprised to find out that alumni have been giving $15,000+ gifts in response to annual appeals, with no follow-up from major gift officers. She calls you up and says: I need to a report on everyone who has given $15,000 or more this year who isn’t yet in a portfolio, and I need it right away! You could probably have a savedlist ready before she’s even hung up the phone: important_prospects = gave_to_area(business, at_least = 15000, from = 20160101) %but_not% in_unit_portfolio(business) display(important_prospects) ## # A tibble: 485 x 1 ## entity_id ## &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 2723 ## 2 3923 ## 3 5355 ## 4 5671 ## 5 5832 ## 6 5833 ## 7 8481 ## 8 10980 ## 9 11346 ## 10 12789 ## # … with 475 more rows "],

["matrix-bot.html", "9 The Matrix Bot 9.1 Introduction 9.2 What it is 9.3 Example 9.4 Botstrapping 9.5 How does it work?", " 9 The Matrix Bot 9.1 Introduction # as always, i have to make sure the disco engine is loaded library(discoveryengine) The brainstorm bot is powered by a simple text search of our code tables. It relies on your search term appearing in the description of a particular code. That’s similar to the sort of search you might encounter on a library website that looks for exact text matches to your search term in the title and perhaps keywords associated with a book. But what if there are relevant facts about (for example) a student activity that are not captured in its name? As a concrete example, if your definition includes music majors, it’s possible (depending on your goals) that you’d also want to take a look at people who had participated in the student group CNMAT, which stands for “Center for New Music and Audio Technologies.” But how would you find that? The student activity code for CNMAT is LSCN, and the description that appears in the code table is “CNMAT Users Group.” We don’t store longer descriptions or other metadata about student groups the way we do with allocations (which allows us to do in-depth searches of fund terms and biographies). The word “music” does not appear in the code table entry for CNMAT, and so this code would slip by both the synonym search and the Brainstorm Bot search. Just when we’re about to lose hope, enter the Matrix Bot. Whoa 9.2 What it is The Matrix Bot analyzes an existing Disco Definition and looks for additional codes that might be related. It’s a good way to broaden your search when you’re doing open-ended prospecting. If the Brainstorm Bot is like looking up a book in the card catalog, then the Matrix Bot is like walking through the stacks to the shelves where your book is located, and glancing at all of other books that have been shelved in the same general location. Note that you have to provide it with a Disco Engine definition to start (unlike the Brainstorm Bot, which only requires one or more search terms). 9.3 Example We’re interested in finding musicians, so we start with music majors: is_musician = majored_in(music) But, since this is an open-ended prospecting project, we call up the Matrix Bot to widen the net: matrix_bot(is_musician) ## attended_event ## 3271: L&amp;S Music Dept Welcome Back Event ## 774: Creation Reception ## 2803: Music Lib.

As with the Brainstorm Bot, the Matrix Bot results are best thought of as suggestions for further research: not all of the suggestions will be helpful for your particular project, and the best way to proceed is to research and learn more about the codes it suggests, to see if they are relevant to your project. 9.4 Botstrapping Recall that the brainstorm bot returns a valid Disco Engine definition (more precisely, it returns the result of combining all of its suggestions using %or%). While we don’t often use that fact (it’s much more common to find yourself copying/pasting from the brainstorm bot results to select the widgets you want to use), it does lend to itself to a nice trick. We can use the matrix bot on brainstorm bot results to quickly and effortlessly identify a number of prospecting options. For example, if we’re prospecting for the Chicano Studies department, but don’t have a great idea where to start: # i use the wildcard * to search for both &quot;chicano&quot; and &quot;chicana&quot; matrix_bot(brainstorm_bot(&quot;chican*&quot;)) ## attended_event ## 5883: EI Chicano/Latino Graduation 5-1-03 ## 5884: EI Chicano/Latino Graduation 5-1-04 ## 5885: EI Chicano/Latino Graduation 5-1-05 ## 5886: EI Chicano/Latino Graduation 5-1-06 ## 5887: EI Chicano/Latino Graduation 5-1-07 ## 5891: EI Chicano/Latino Graduation 5-1-12 ## 8864: Chicano Latino Chap Summer Welcome Party ## 8865: Chicano Latino Chap Summer Welcome Party ## 8895: Chicano Latino Chap Summer Welcome Party ## 8896: Chicano Latino Chapter Noche de Osos ## 5882: EI Chicano/Latino Graduation 5-1-02 ## 5889: EI Chicano/Latino Graduation 5-1-09 ## 5890: EI Chicano/Latino Graduation 5-1-10 ## 8420: Chicano Latino Chapter Noche de Osos ## 5348: EI Chicano Latino Graduation 5-15-2011 ## 5888: EI Chicano/Latino Graduation 5-1-08 ## 3231: Sandra Hare Welcome Rec. ## 4454: CAA Mento Chic/Lat Ptshp ## 9435: Student Welcome Reception ## 8237: All-UC Latino Career Networking Event ## 4867: L&amp;S 10th Anniversary Ethnic Studies Libr ## 4310: Boalt La Raza Recept. ## ca_gave_to_candidate ## CA4219530495: LARA, RICARDO ## CA1613744954: GUILLEN, ABEL ## fec_gave_to_candidate ## H2CA10145: HERNANDEZ, JOSE M ## H2CA36439: RUIZ, RAUL DR. ## gave_to_department ## CHICANO: Chicano Studies Program ## MSGC: Multiculture, Sex &amp; Gender Ctrs ## ETHNIC: Ethnic Studies ## TRSP: Transfer/ReEntry/Parent Ctr ## SAGE: SAGE Scholars Program ## VCEIO: Equity &amp; Inclusion: VC&#39;s Office ## CLL: Campus Life/Leadership ## SLC: Student Learning Center ## CEEE: Educ Equity &amp; Excellence Centers ## CEP: Educational Partnerships Center ## OGB: Order of the Golden Bear ## SW: Social Welfare ## has_affiliation ## MA27: CAA Chicano/Latino Alumni Volunteer ## RC15: CAA Chicanx Latinx Alumni Assoc Nor Cal ## RC5: *CAA La Raza Alumni Club-Defunct ## LSBSP: Biology Scholars Program ## MA17: TAAP/KASP Scholarship Interviewer ## MA5: CAA Student Recruitment/Outreach Pgm ## RC11: *CAA Alumni Club Officer ## MA30: TAAP/KASP Scholarship Reader ## RC18: CAA Cal Alumni Los Angeles Chapter ## has_interest ## MEX: Mexican-American/Chicano Interest ## USL: U.S. Latino Interests ## LAT: Latin American Interests ## has_occupation ## 2100: Social Svcs/Community Relation ## majored_in ## 160: Chicano Studies ## 919: Spanish Option D: Hispanic ## 360: Ethnic Studies ## 907: Spanish Option C2: Latin American ## 498: Latin American Studies ## 9A1: Gender &amp; Women&#39;s Studies ## 882: Spanish ## 045: American Studies ## participated_in ## EDCH: Chicano Latina Arch Stdnt Assn ## LSCI: Chicano Studies Undergrad Assoc ## LSCL: Chicano/Latino Political Sci Assoc ## UCHE: Chicanxs/Latinxs in Health Education ## UMEC: Movimiento Estud Chicano de Aztlan ## GLTA: Lambda Theta Alpha Latin Sorority ## UMAL: Mujeres Activas En Letras (MALCS) ## UXIN: Xinaxtli ## ULPL: Latino Pre-Law Society ## ULV: La Voz ## UTRE: TRENZA ## GLTP: Lambda Theta Phi Latin Fraternity ## UHAU: Hermanas Unidas ## ULAS: Latin American Student Association ## GLTN: Lambda Theta Nu Sorority ## UHSF: Hispanic Scholarship Fund Scholars ## UGFR: Grupo Folklorico Reflejos De Mexico ## GGZA: Gamma Zeta Alpha ## GSPA: Sigma Pi Alpha Sorority ## UMCH: MEChXA ## UHU: Hermanos Unidos ## UDUL: DULCE-Cmnty Diabetes Educ &amp; Prev ## UYQU: Young Queers United 4 Empow (Y Que) ## UEGI: Global Internship ## ULF: La Familia ## URRR: Raza Recruitment &amp; Retention Center ## RCRR: Raices Recruitment &amp; Retention ## GMGC: Multicultural Greek Council ## URS: RISE-Rising Immigrant Sch Thru Educ ## EIM: Casa Magdalena Mora ## UESIT: Summer Abroad - Italy ## UHES: Hispanic Engineers &amp; Scientists ## UIAM: IAM Outreach Program ## UESMX: Summer Abroad - Mexico ## BULS: Latino Business Student Association ## ULL: La Llorona ## UDCP: Destination: College Program ## EAMEX: Education Abroad Program - Mexico ## UBMC: Bridges Multicultural Resource Ctr ## EID1: DC Advising Corps ## EABRA: Education Abroad Program - Brazil ## LBSIP: IRLE Labor Summer Internship Program ## RHRV: Rochdale Village Co-Op Resident ## LWLS: La Raza Law Students Association ## LRAC: La Raza Alumni Chapter ## EIP1: PDP Calculus Intensive ## LTAD: Latino Alumni Directory ## BIBSP: Biology Scholars Program ## EIT: TAP Transfer Alliance Project ## EISA: Educational Opportunity Program ## USBR: Summer Bridge Program Participant ## UBUI: BUILD Literacy Program ## UBON: Bonner Leaders ## EIR6: TRSP Transfer Student Services ## LWLR: Berkeley La Raza Law Journal ## UESSP: Summer Abroad - Spain ## RHFW: Fenwick Weavers&#39; Village Co-Op ## played_sport ## RSBX: Cal Boxing Club ## received_award ## ZFI: UA Zaffaroni Scholarship ## CAS: CAA Achievement Award Scholar ## IAS: Incentive Awards Scholar.

The Matrix Bot looks up entities who match your definition, and then looks for other characteristics they have in common. The theory is that if a lot of people who have characteristic A (example: majored in music) also happen to have characteristic B (participated in CNMAT Users Group), then there’s probably an underlying similarity between characteristic A and B. This approach is closely related to one laid out in the paper “The Duality of Persons and Groups” by Ronald Breiger. The name “Matrix Bot,” in addition to evoking some Neo-like magic, is also a nod to the basic linear algebra that the bot uses. "],
["higher-order-widgets.html", "10 Higher order widgets 10.1 Children of wealth", " 10 Higher order widgets You may have noticed when we ran the show_widgets() function in working with widgets that there is a mysterious “Order” column that categorizes widgets as either “first-order” or “second-order”. What’s that all about? In order to answer that, let’s take a look at another example. 10.1 Children of wealth Many alumni in our database do not have capacity ratings, but come from wealthy families. This would be nice to be aware of if they were ever being solicited. But how could we identify these “children of wealth” using the discovery engine? It’s pretty easy to find wealthy individuals: # as always, i make sure the disco engine is loaded library(discoveryengine) # i&#39;ll define wealthy as a capacity of $1 Million+ wealthy = has_capacity(1:7) But now I’m stuck. I want to find children of anyone on that list. But so far all of the widgets we’ve seen work with specific codes, not other widgets. Technically, all the widgets we’ve seen are first-order widgets. But we do have some widgets that, instead of working on one or more specific codes, works on an existing, already filled out widget. child_of is one such second-order widget: child_of_wealth = child_of(wealthy) display(child_of_wealth) ## # A tibble: 1,299 x 1 ## entity_id ## &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 155 ## 2 1347 ## 3 1529 ## 4 2497 ## 5 3181 ## 6 3296 ## 7 3308 ## 8 3418 ## 9 3442 ## 10 3897 ## # … with 1,289 more rows Though the syntax looks just like what we’ve been doing all along, note that wealthy in the above is not a code or synonym, but instead is the name that I gave to the definition has_capacity(1:7). This makes child_of very different from other widgets we’ve seen so far. As we’ll see in the next seciton, the ability to use second-order widgets allows us to do some very powerful things. The result of using a second-order widget, though, is just like using any other widget. You can continue to combine it with other widgets: display(child_of_wealth %and% lives_in_msa(san_francisco)) ## # A tibble: 509 x 1 ## entity_id ## &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 155 ## 2 1529 ## 3 2497 ## 4 3296 ## 5 3418 ## 6 3442 ## 7 3897 ## 8 4539 ## 9 4540 ## 10 5084 ## # … with 499 more rows # or even display( child_of(child_of_wealth) ) ## # A tibble: 148 x 1 ## entity_id ## &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 22266 ## 2 22307 ## 3 23574 ## 4 25856 ## 5 26067 ## 6 27804 ## 7 28003 ## 8 28405 ## 9 28586 ## 10 28891 ## # … with 138 more rows "],
["non-entity-widgets.html", "11 Non-entity widgets 11.1 Motivation 11.2 Disco Definition Types 11.3 Searching fund text 11.4 From funds to entities 11.5 “Converters”", " 11 Non-entity widgets 11.1 Motivation In CADSmart, there is a report called the Fundfinder, which allows you to search for allocations that contain specific words or phrases in the name, fund terms, or fund biography. A natural application is to use the report to find some allocations, and then turn around and get a list of entities who have given to those funds. So far, we haven’t seen how to do that in the disco engine, but that’s about to change. Before reading this section, make sure you understand higher order widgets. 11.2 Disco Definition Types Let’s take a closer look at a widget we’ve already used a lot, the has_capacity widget. In particular, let’s look at the definition that gets created when we use has_capacity: has_capacity(1) ## LISTBUILDER DEFINITION (type: entity_id) ## . source: d_entity_mv.entity_id (entity_id) ## . logic: capacity_rating_code IN (1) See in parentheses in the first line where it says type: entity_id? So entity_id is the “type” of the definition we’ve created. And as you may have guessed by now, we can also create other types of definition! 11.3 Searching fund text The Fundfinder report does not give you a list of entities, it gives you a list of allocations. You are then expected to use a different report to find donors to those allocations. We’ll follow a similar (but hopefully more convenient) strategy with the disco engine. We start by using fund_text_contains to do a text search of fund terms/biographies/names (for more info, check the help file by typing ?fund_text_contains). fund_text_contains, like all text-searching tools in the discoveryengine, allows you to enter as many search terms as you like, and to use wildcards (*): # let&#39;s look for funds that support diversity/underrepresented students diversity_funds = fund_text_contains(&quot;divers*&quot;, &quot;underrepresented&quot;) The definition looks pretty complex, but notice that first line – this time around, instead of entity_id, we have type: allocation_code: diversity_funds ## LISTBUILDER DEFINITION (type: allocation_code) ## . operator (KY51): union all ## . left (KY51): ## . . source: f_allocation_mv.allocation_code (allocation_code) ## . . logic: regexp_like(long_name, &#39;((^|\\\\s|\\\\W)divers)|((^|\\\\s|\\\\W)underrepresented($|\\\\s|\\\\W))&#39;, &#39;i&#39;) ## . right (KY51): ## . . operator (VE91): union all ## . . left (VE91): ## . . . operator (LD43): union all ## . . . left (LD43): ## . . . . source: f_notes_mv.allocation_code (allocation_code) ## . . . . logic: ## . . . . . regexp_like(description, &#39;((^|\\\\s|\\\\W)divers)|((^|\\\\s|\\\\W)underrepresented($|\\\\s|\\\\W))&#39;, &#39;i&#39;) ## . . . . . note_type IN (&#39;FT&#39;, &#39;FB&#39;) ## . . . right (LD43): ## . . . . source: f_notes_mv.allocation_code (allocation_code) ## . . . . logic: ## . . . . . regexp_like(brief_note, &#39;((^|\\\\s|\\\\W)divers)|((^|\\\\s|\\\\W)underrepresented($|\\\\s|\\\\W))&#39;, &#39;i&#39;) ## . . . . . note_type IN (&#39;FT&#39;, &#39;FB&#39;) ## . . right (VE91): ## . . . source: f_notes_mv.allocation_code (allocation_code) ## . . . logic: ## . . . . regexp_like(note_text, &#39;((^|\\\\s|\\\\W)divers)|((^|\\\\s|\\\\W)underrepresented($|\\\\s|\\\\W))&#39;, &#39;i&#39;) ## . . . . note_type IN (&#39;FT&#39;, &#39;FB&#39;) And in fact, if we run display, we’ll see a list of allocation codes instead of the entity IDs that we’ve seen in previous examples: display(diversity_funds) ## # A tibble: 294 x 1 ## allocation_code ## &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 R88958000 ## 2 R58436002 ## 3 R51943000 ## 4 R40872000 ## 5 FN1286000 ## 6 R48968000 ## 7 R57642000 ## 8 R50827000 ## 9 R45260000 ## 10 R91600000 ## # … with 284 more rows 11.4 From funds to entities If all you needed to do was get a list of allocation codes for your own research, then congrats, you’re done! But what if you want to take the next step, and find donors to those funds? You use one of the tools to find widgets to discover the gave_to_fund widget (read more at ?gave_to_fund). Though it looks on the surface pretty similar to gave_to_area and gave_to_department, it is in fact one of those second-order widgets! # gave_to_fund has the same interface/options # as gave_to_area and gave_to_department. diversity_donors = gave_to_fund(diversity_funds, at_least = 10000, from = 20150101, to = 20151231) display(diversity_donors) ## # A tibble: 31 x 1 ## entity_id ## &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 867 ## 2 10469 ## 3 12100 ## 4 16607 ## 5 21393 ## 6 22653 ## 7 23207 ## 8 24473 ## 9 27771 ## 10 28097 ## # … with 21 more rows 11.5 “Converters” Examples like this one show how higher-order widgets can act as “converters,” converting one type of definition (like allocation_code) to another (like entity_id). This is a handy idea to have in the back of your mind. If you find yourself with an ID list definition that has the wrong type of ID, see if you can find a second-order widget that will “convert” it to the right type. "],
["optional-arguments.html", "12 Optional arguments 12.1 Event invitees and attendees 12.2 Date ranges 12.3 Graduate, undergraduate, attendee 12.4 Workarounds: inactive only", " 12 Optional arguments As we saw in Working with widgets, many widgets have optional arguments that provide fine-grained control. You can always view the full documentation for a widget, including all of its arguments, by using the built-in help (e.g. ?majored_in). We are able to make these arguments optional because widgets come pre-configured with default settings for these arguments (the default settings are also explained in the help). 12.1 Event invitees and attendees For example, absent any additional instructions, attended_event will exclude anyone who was invited but did not attend the specified events. So to create a definition of people who attended CNR’s “Re-discover ESPM” event: attended_event(2770) ## LISTBUILDER DEFINITION (type: entity_id) ## . source: d_bio_activity_mv.entity_id (entity_id) ## . logic: ## . . activity_code IN (&#39;2770&#39;) ## . . activity_participation_code IN (&#39;P&#39;, &#39;ST&#39;, &#39;SP&#39;, &#39;V&#39;, &#39;H&#39;, &#39;S&#39;, &#39;C&#39;, &#39;KN&#39;, &#39;MD&#39;, &#39;E&#39;, &#39;OL&#39;, &#39;IS&#39;) Since I did not specify otherwise, that definition will only pull in those who actually attended, not those who were merely invited. If I were interested not only in those who actually attended, but also anyone who was merely invited (this can be useful because it indicates that a person was at least considered an invite-worthy prospect), I would add include_non_attendees = TRUE to my specification: attended_event(2770, include_non_attendees = TRUE) ## LISTBUILDER DEFINITION (type: entity_id) ## . source: d_bio_activity_mv.entity_id (entity_id) ## . logic: ## . . activity_code IN (&#39;2770&#39;) ## . . activity_participation_code IN (&#39;P&#39;, &#39;ST&#39;, &#39;SP&#39;, &#39;V&#39;, &#39;H&#39;, &#39;S&#39;, &#39;C&#39;, &#39;KN&#39;, &#39;MD&#39;, &#39;E&#39;, &#39;OL&#39;, &#39;IS&#39;, &#39;ID&#39;, &#39;RG&#39;, &#39;NS&#39;, &#39;RU&#39;) If you look closely at the printed output from each of those defintions, in the logic section, you’ll notice slightly different lists of codes included where it says activity_participation_code IN .... In fact, the latter includes the extra codes ID (for “Invited but did not attend”), RG (“Regrets”), and NS (“No Show”). 12.2 Date ranges A number of widgets, including all of the giving-related widgets as well as degree/major widgets, have two optional arguments, called from and to, to specify a date range. Their being optional means that you can specify none, just one, or both of the from and to arguments, resulting in the following behaviors: None: Dates will not be considered at all. So for example, gave_to_area(chemistry) will look at people’s entire lifetime of giving for any gifts to the College of Chemistry Only from: The date range will be considered open-ended on the right (future) side, but closed on the left (past). So gave_to_area(chemistry, from = 20010101) will look for anyone who has given to the College of Chemistry since the beginning of the year 2001, ignoring any giving that happened earlier than that. Only to: The date range will be considered open-ended on the left (past), but closed on the right (future). So gave_to_area(chemistry, to = 20080630) will consider any giving on or before June 30, 2008, ignoring any giving that happened after that date. Both: Just a daterange. gave_to_area(chemistry, from = 20010101, to = 20080630) will look for giving to the College of Chemistry between January 1, 2001 and June 30, 2008. 12.3 Graduate, undergraduate, attendee For the most part, widgets have just a small number of options, and they are designed to be easy to get your head around. Should we include inactive records, yes or no? That kind of thing. Academic/degree-related widgets, including majored_in, has_degree_from, has_degree, and minored_in have a somewhat more complex set of possibilites, arising from the fact that we can pull degreeholders, attendees, or current students, and graduates as well as undergraduates. We’ll look at a couple of examples here, for more detailed explanations, see the academic widgets example: majored_in(womens_studies): By default, we look for both graduate and undergraduate degreeholders. Only those who completed a degree in Women’s Studies will be included. majored_in(womens_studies, attendees = TRUE): By adding attendees = TRUE, we include any attendee, undergraduate or graduate, in addition to the degreeholders. majored_in(womens_studies, undergraduates = FALSE, current_students = TRUE): Here we’re only interested in graduate-level Women’s Studies majors, including degreeholders and current students (but not attendees). We’ll ignore undergraduate degreeholders as well as current undergraduate students. We’ll include anyone who studied or is currently studying Women’s Studies at the graduate level. Though it has the same meaning and will have the same results, in cases like this it’s helpful to be explicit so you don’t get confused later: majored_in( womens_studies, undergraduates = FALSE, graduates = TRUE, # not necessary (it&#39;s TRUE by default), but more clear current_students = TRUE ) There are more examples using the academic widgets in the examples gallery. 12.4 Workarounds: inactive only Sometimes the simplicity of a widget interface can make it seem insufficiently flexible. For example, what if we wanted to look at only people who were once in a library portfolio, but no longer are? By looking at ?in_unit_portfolio, I can see that the unit portfolio widget has an option include_inactive which is FALSE by default, but there is no include_active or any such option. I can do in_unit_portfolio(library, include_inactive = TRUE), but that will include people who are still in a Library portfolio. In order to get around this limitation, I’ll have to get a little creative. I’ll pull anyone in the library portfolio, whether active or inactive, but then I’ll exclude those who are only in an active portfolio: # first define what it means to have ever been in a library portfolio current_or_former = in_unit_portfolio(library, include_inactive = TRUE) # now define being in a &quot;current&quot; portfolio # note that include_inactive = FALSE is not necessary here, # since that is the default setting for that argument, but # i include it here because it makes my intent more clear current = in_unit_portfolio(library, include_inactive = FALSE) # to find only the former portfolio: former = current_or_former %but_not% current This little trick is similar to the one we use in the LYBUNT example.

For an introduction with examples, check the official README. 13.2 discovcr discovcr allows you to browse data related to your discovery engine definition and select just the IDs you want to keep. This can be particularly useful when using text-search widgets such as fund_text_contains, where you may want to review the individual allocations you captured in your original search and remove any that were false matches (for example, a search for funds related to “diversity” brings in a number of biology research funds related to bio-diversity). For a detailed introduction to using discovcr, read the “vignette” that includes examples and instructions by typing: vignette(&quot;vcr-intro&quot;, package = &quot;discovcr&quot;) 13.3 discoscape The discoscape package serves as a bridge between the Discovery Engine and DonorScape. The donorscape_report function outputs data in the format required by the DonorScape screening service, so that you can discover and/or define a population using the Discovery Engine, and then immediately run that population through a DonorScape without much hassle in between. As with any package, you can load it up by using the library function: library(discoscape) The main function is called donorscape_report, and you can learn more about it by typing: ?donorscape_report "],

Some follow-up clarified that the “Haas Center” here is referring to the Haas Institute for a fair and inclusive society . I don’t know if that is an area of giving, a department, a fund?

That is, someone who gave last year but has not given this year. How can we create such a definition in the Disco Engine? To make the example concrete, let’s say we’re identifying LYBUNTs for the school of Social Welfare. What I’d like to get to is: LYBUNT = last_year %but_not% this_year So, all I really need to do is define last_year and this_year. I’m writing this example in September, 2016, so I’ll define “last year” as FY2015-16, or in other words, July 1, 2015 - June 30, 2016: last_year = gave_to_area(social_welfare, from = 20150701, to = 20160630) And now for this year. Since the to argument is optional, I can just do: this_year = gave_to_area(social_welfare, from = 20160701) Now I can create my LYBUNT definition, as I strategized above: LYBUNT = last_year %but_not% this_year display(LYBUNT) ## # A tibble: 186 x 1 ## entity_id ## &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 448 ## 2 548 ## 3 3408 ## 4 10025 ## 5 14061 ## 6 14063 ## 7 18578 ## 8 22160 ## 9 25099 ## 10 30764 ## # … with 176 more rows Finally, recall that every widget has a default set up if you don’t enter any codes.

They are tentatively holding the event at the Claremont Resort, but want to be sure that there are enough recent band parents who live close enough to attend. So our job is to build a definition of parents of recent band graduates who live near the Claremont Resort. Then we can just use display to view how many people fit the definition. 16.1 Recent band members First I need to find out how to identify marching band members. I’ll use the brainstorm bot: brainstorm_bot(&quot;marching band&quot;) ## participated_in ## MSMB: UC Marching Band Member Cool.

That status comes with recognition and other perks, so it’s valuable to be aware of households who are nearing that level, as we can then craft solicitations that would push the household into Builder status. 17.1 Defining close For this example, I’ll use $850,000 as the definition of “close” to the $1 Million Builder level. So we’re trying to find households who have given at least $850,000, but not over $1 Million. Recall that the giving widgets, when used without any area or department codes, look at giving anywhere on campus (which is what we want). # B.O.B. is a lifetime recognition. Pull lifetime giving by not using the # date range in the gave_to_area widget nearly_builder = gave_to_area(at_least = 850000) To exclude those who are already over $1M (who are already Builders), I first need to identify them: already_builder = gave_to_area(at_least = 1000000) Now, I want to find everyone who satisfies nearly_builder but are not already_builder: prospect_list = nearly_builder %but_not% already_builder Let’s see what we have! display(prospect_list) ## # A tibble: 78 x 1 ## entity_id ## &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 566 ## 2 1306 ## 3 3119 ## 4 5832 ## 5 5833 ## 6 7318 ## 7 8872 ## 8 11724 ## 9 15333 ## 10 15771 ## # … with 68 more rows 17.2 Householding A lot of individuals in prospect_list are married to each other, but Builder of Berkeley is a household recognition.

This data makes its way into some of our predictive models, but on occasion it is useful to use the data directly. 19.1 Basics The Disco Engine provides the following FEC widgets: fec_gave_to_committee fec_gave_to_candidate fec_gave_to_category Since the names of all of these related widgets begin with the same prefix, they are easy to find using RStudio’s auto-completion: just type “fec_” The candidate and committee widgets should be pretty self-explanatory. fec_gave_to_category is based on a categorization of PACs and other committees done by the Center for Responsive Politics (opensecrets.org). All of the widgets have the same interface as the giving widgets, meaning you can specify date ranges and minimum amounts when using them. For example, to find donors to Kamala Harris’s CA senate campaign who gave at least $500 between January 1, 2016 and November 1, 2016: fec_gave_to_candidate(harris_kamala_d, at_least = 500, from = 20160101, to = 20161101) As that example shows, the system of codes and synonyms works the same way with the FEC widgets as with any other widget. Synonym search is particularly useful with these widgets: fec_gave_to_category(?abortion) ## Regular codes and synonyms: ## synonym code ## abortion_policy_anti_abortion J7120 ## abortion_policy_pro_abortion_rights J7150 19.2 Example: Engineering Prospects A fundraiser might like to know if any of her prospects have recently made sizable political contributions: # as with other widgets, leaving the committee code blank means i&#39;m looking # for giving to any committee political_engineering_prospect = in_unit_portfolio(engineering) %and% fec_gave_to_committee(at_least = 5000, from = 20170101, to = 20171031) display(political_engineering_prospect) ## # A tibble: 27 x 1 ## entity_id ## &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 616 ## 2 5881 ## 3 15333 ## 4 16641 ## 5 17677 ## 6 21091 ## 7 30551 ## 8 130078 ## 9 229827 ## 10 283796 ## # … with 17 more rows 19.3 Example: Environmental Interest We can use political giving to identify constituent interest in the environment.

Next, I might look for people who have expressed an interest in the environment by making political contributions to environmental policy organizations, but who have not already been coded with the has_uncoded_environment_interest = fec_gave_to_category(environmental_policy) %but_not% has_interest(environment) display(has_uncoded_environment_interest) ## # A tibble: 2 x 1 ## entity_id ## &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 3178462 ## 2 3178463 19.4 Bots Just like any other widget, FEC widgets are plugged in to the Brainstorm Bot and Matrix Bot.

The widgets to access this data are similar in form and function to the FEC widgets. They are: ca_gave_to_candidate ca_gave_to_proposition ca_gave The first two widgets only look at contributions in campaigns for statewide office. However, the Secretary of State’s “Cal Access” database includes a number of transactions that don’t fit into either of those two categories. For instance, contributions to a campaign for Superior Court Judge (who run locally, not statewide) or contributions to committees that are not directly affiliated with a single candidate/proposition (such as the Democratic State Central Committee of California). In order to be able to find any kind of contribution, use ca_gave, which includes giving to statewide candidates and propositions as well as any other disclosed giving. 20.1 Example: State Senate and Assembly candidates The UC Berkeley Foundation is holding an event which will feature appearances by State assembly member Phil Ting, former state senator and assembly member Holly Mitchell, and state senator (and former state assembly member) Jim Beall. In preparation for the event, they ask you to find out who among our constituents have contributed to these officials’ campaigns when they were running for office and do some preliminary research on them. We start by identifying the candidate IDs for those candidates, using the same synonym search tool that works in every widget: ca_gave_to_candidate(?mitchell, ?ting, ?beall) ## Regular codes and synonyms: ## synonym code ## mitchell_holly CA1223588942 ## mitchell_holly_j CA3479738832 ## ing_mitchell CA1065733190 ## ting_phil CA657102211 ## keating_janice CA15407672 ## keating_janice_e CA2583880518 ## beall_jim CA3663467903 Once we know the correct candidate codes, we can pull contributors: donors = ca_gave_to_candidate(CA657102211, CA1223588942, CA3663467903) display(donors) ## # A tibble: 366 x 1 ## entity_id ## &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 331 ## 2 1303 ## 3 8666 ## 4 11015 ## 5 12306 ## 6 12453 ## 7 14259 ## 8 15683 ## 9 16251 ## 10 16374 ## # … with 356 more rows Just like giving and FEC widgets, the California campaign finance widgets all support the following optional arguments: at_least: to find donors with total contributions over a specified amount. By default, this is assumed to be 1 cent. from and to: to constrain the date range when looking for contributions. By default, all matched contributions will be searched regardless of date. Prospect Development’s California campaign finance database goes back to 2006. 20.2 Propositions The process for ballot propositions is pretty similar to the one for candidates, but with the added complication that donors to proposition campaigns can be either supporting or opposed to the proposition in question. An example will help illustrate. If you’re looking for prospects who are interested in public education, you might end up considering donors to propositions 30 (in the 2011-12 cycle) and 55 (in the 2015-15 cycle). Prop 30 raised taxes in order to pay for both public K-12 schools as well as community colleges, and Prop 55 extended those tax increases. Once again, we’ll start with a synonym search: ca_gave_to_proposition(?education) ## Regular codes and synonyms: ## synonym ## kindergarten_university_public_education_facilities_bond_act_of_2004 ## ab_127_chapter_35_2006_nunez_education_facilities_kindergarten_university_public_edu ## education_funding_real_property_parcel_tax_initiative_constitutional_amendment_and_statu ## sb_1174_chapter_753_statutes_of_2014_lara_english_language_education ## kindergarten_university_public_education_facilities_bond_act_of_2002 ## education_funding_payment_plan ## tax_for_early_education_and_early_childhood_programs_initiative_statute ## public_preschool_education_tax_increase_on_incomes_over_400000_for_individuals_80000 ## temporary_taxes_to_fund_education_guaranteed_local_public_safety_funding_initiat ## tax_extension_to_fund_education_and_healthcare_initiative_constitutional_amendmen ## code ## BL20030055 ## BL2005001D ## BL20050088 ## BL20150058 ## BL20010047 ## BL2009001B ## BL20110038 ## BL20050082 ## BL20110030 ## BL20150055 The code field looks at first like it is completely meaningless, but take a closer look at you might notice: the last 4 characters are the proposition number (e.g. 0055), while the 4 characters before that are the start of the election cycle that the proposition was a part of (so 2015 refers to the 2015-16 election cycle). So for this project, I’d use BL20150055 and BL20110030. By default, ca_gave_to_proposition will pull both supporters and oppononents of the propositions. While that may be useful if you’re just looking for wealth indicators, you probably want to specify one or the other for any affinity-based work. So: # to pull supporters of a tax increase to fund education: tax_supporter = ca_gave_to_proposition(BL20150055, BL20110030, support = TRUE) # and opponents: tax_opponent = ca_gave_to_proposition(BL20150055, BL20110030, support = FALSE) A quick glance at the Matrix Bot results give us a good idea of which side of the political aisle these two groups are coming from: matrix_bot(tax_supporter) ## ca_gave_to_candidate ## CA545453741: DE LEON, KEVIN ## CA3415765751: OSBORN, TORIE ## CA3789174547: YEE, BETTY T. ## CA580635557: PAVLEY, FRAN ## CA2025703811: STERN, HENRY ## CA165165894: TORLAKSON, TOM ## CA1322715128: BECERRA, XAVIER ## CA1664107145: YEE , BETTY T. ## CA941720645: SKINNER, NANCY ## fec_gave_to_candidate ## H4CA21072: RENTERIA, AMANDA ## H0CA33117: BASS, KAREN ## H8CA10167: COX, TERRANCE JOHN (TJ) ## S4MA00028: MARKEY, EDWARD JOHN MR ## H2CA31125: AGUILAR, PETE ## H2CA36439: RUIZ, RAUL DR. ## H6AZ08038: GIFFORDS, GABRIELLE ## H4CA10075: EGGMAN, MICHAEL RAY ## H8NV03036: TITUS, DINA ## S6OH00254: STRICKLAND, TED ## H8CO04067: MARKEY, ELIZABETH HELEN ## S2IN00091: DONNELLY, JOSEPH S ## S6MO00362: KANDER, JASON ## S4MI00355: PETERS, GARY ## S8AK00090: BEGICH, MARK ## H2CA43245: TAKANO, MARK ## H2CA52089: PETERS, SCOTT ## H8CA22089: CAPPS, LOIS ## S8ME00080: ALLEN, THOMAS H ## S6PA00100: SPECTER, ARLEN ## H2CA26026: BERMAN, HOWARD L. ## H2MA04073: KENNEDY, JOSEPH P III ## H2CA00120: BROWNLEY, JULIA ## H6CA04123: BROWN, CHARLES ## S4GA11277: NUNN, MARY MICHELLE ## S8CO00172: UDALL, MARK E ## S2NM00088: HEINRICH, MARTIN TREVOR ## S6NV00028: REID, HARRY ## S6LA00227: LANDRIEU, MARY L ## S6PA00266: MCGINTY, KATHLEEN ALANA ## S2ND00099: HEITKAMP, HEIDI ## S6VA00093: WARNER, MARK ROBERT ## S8FL00166: NELSON, BILL ## S8NY00082: SCHUMER, CHARLES E ## S8NC00239: HAGAN, KAY R ## S6NV00200: MASTO, CATHERINE CORTEZ ## H0CA27085: SCHIFF, ADAM ## S2VA00142: KAINE, TIMOTHY MICHAEL ## S4NJ00185: BOOKER, CORY A ## S2NV00209: BERKLEY, SHELLEY ## H0CA10149: GARAMENDI, JOHN ## S8NM00184: UDALL, TOM ## H0CA03078: BERA, AMERISH ## S0NH00219: SHAHEEN, JEANNE ## H8CA05035: PELOSI, NANCY ## S0CO00211: BENNET, MICHAEL F ## S6NH00091: HASSAN, MARGARET WOOD ## S6MO00305: MCCASKILL, CLAIRE ## S8MI00281: STABENOW, DEBBIE ## S6IL00292: DUCKWORTH, L TAMMY ## H4CA11081: MCNERNEY, JERRY ## S2WA00189: MURRAY, PATTY ## S6MT00162: TESTER, JON ## S6OH00163: BROWN, SHERROD ## S8OR00207: MERKLEY, JEFFREY ALAN ## S8WI00026: FEINGOLD, RUSSELL DANA ## S0CA00199: FEINSTEIN, DIANNE ## S8WA00194: CANTWELL, MARIA ## S6CA00584: HARRIS, KAMALA D ## S8MN00438: FRANKEN, AL ## S2WI00219: BALDWIN, TAMMY ## S0NY00410: GILLIBRAND, KIRSTEN ELIZABETH ## S0AL00156: JONES, DOUG ## S2CA00286: BOXER, BARBARA ## S2MA00170: WARREN, ELIZABETH ## fec_gave_to_category ## J2100: Democratic leadership PAC ## J7500: Minority/Ethnic Groups ## Y0000: Unknown ## J1200: Democratic/Liberal ## gave_to_department ## PP: Public Policy ## CEEE: Educ Equity &amp; Excellence Centers ## has_affiliation ## BLDR: Builders of Berkeley ## has_interest ## HUR: Human Rights ## PCY: Public Policy ## ENV: Environment ## DIV: Diverse Constituencies matrix_bot(tax_opponent) ## ca_gave_to_candidate ## CA1403064487: STRICKLAND, TONY ## CA3516489204: POIZNER, STEVE ## CA643204175: WHITMAN, MARGARET C. ## CA4012945810: MC CLINTOCK, THOMAS ## CA1728102410: BAKER, CATHARINE ## CA4083971340: SCHWARZENEGGER, ARNOLD ## fec_gave_to_candidate ## S4AR00103: COTTON, THOMAS ## H0CA10123: HARMER, DAVID ## S0OH00133: PORTMAN, ROB ## S0NV00138: ANGLE, SHARRON E ## S2OH00170: MANDEL, JOSH ## S0MA00109: BROWN, SCOTT P ## S0SC00149: GRAHAM, LINDSEY OLIN ## S0FL00338: RUBIO, MARCO ## H2CA11135: GILL, RICKY ## H6CA22125: MCCARTHY, KEVIN ## S0CA00330: FIORINA, CARLY ## H0OH08029: BOEHNER, JOHN A. ## H8WI01024: RYAN, PAUL D. ## S2CA00351: CAMPBELL, TOM ## P80003353: ROMNEY, MITT / RYAN, PAUL D. ## P80002801: MCCAIN, JOHN S. ## fec_gave_to_category ## J1100: Republican/Conservative ## J2200: Republican leadership PAC ## Z4100: Republican Joint Candidate Committee ## Z5100: Republican Party Committees ## Z1100: Republican Candidate Committees ## has_interest ## VEN: Venture Capital ## BUS: Business ## REP: Republican Politics "],
["ex-academic.html", "21 Alumni and current students", " 21 Alumni and current students Several widgets in the Discovery Engine utilize degree information, including has_degree_from, majored_in, minored_in, and has_degree. These widgets are set up to select undergraduate and graduate degreeholders, but have options to include or exclude attendees and current students as well. Because of the number of options available, these widgets may seem complex at first. These examples go over some of the more common cases. Every degree/academic-related widget includes the following options for specifying degree status: degreeholders: whether to include (TRUE) or exclude (FALSE) degreeholders. By default, degreeholders = TRUE attendees: include or exclude attendees – these are people who attended UC Berkeley at some point (possibly just for one or two classes), but did not receive a degree. Defaults to FALSE current_students: include/exclude current students. Defaults to FALSE They also include these options for specifying the level of attendance: undergraduates: whether to include (TRUE) or exclude (FALSE) undergraduate students/alumni. Defaults to TRUE graduates: include or exclude graduate students/alumni. Defaults to TRUE Finally, there are the options to specify dates, from and to. Dates are assumed to refer to when someone completed their stay at Berkeley (so the graduation date in the case of degreeholders, and the stop date for attendees). from and to are ignored when looking at current students. It can be helpful to think of all the options in terms of a grid: By default, all academic widgets include only undergraduate and graduate degreeholders: Since those are the defaults, the code to get Chemistry degreeholders (undergraduate or graduate) is concise: has_degree_from(CH) What if I only want undergraduate degreeholders? has_degree_from(CH, graduates = FALSE) Note: the reason I didn’t have to type undergraduates = TRUE there is because that is the default. When in doubt, you always have the option of being explicit: has_degree_from(CH, graduates = FALSE, undergraduates = TRUE) When doing parents prospecting, it is common to need to look for current students. has_degree_from(CH, current_students = TRUE, degreeholders = FALSE, graduates = FALSE) has_degree_from searches based on school (Chemistry, Law, Letters &amp; Science, etc.), but other academic widgets have the same options and allow you to search based on major/minor or even the type of degree itself (e.g. Ph.D., JD, Bachelor’s, . . .). Here is how to get current MBA students: has_degree(MBA, current_students = TRUE, degreeholders = FALSE) "],
["ex-sec.html", "22 Mining SEC filings 22.1 Basics 22.2 Looking for companies 22.3 Specific roles", " 22 Mining SEC filings # i always begin by loading the disco engine if it isn&#39;t already loaded library(discoveryengine) The SEC is another one of the external data sources that Prospect Analysis regularly screens. Specifically, we utilize SEC Form 3/4/5 filings made by our constituents. These filings are required of “Corporate insiders – meaning a company’s officers and directors, and any beneficial owners of more than ten percent of a class of the company’s equity securities,” and are made whenever an individual first attains that status as a required filer, and then again every time the person buys or sells shares or derivatives in the company. The matched data is used in our predictive models as well as by the Prospect Discovery team, but it can also be valuable to be able to work with the data directly. (Note also that you can use the screening chunk in discoappend – not demonstrated here – in order to see summaries of all matched external data including SEC filings). 22.1 Basics There is one SEC widget, called sec_filed. This name keeps up the Disco Engine’s convention of using a specific prefix to identify widgets that query matched external data (see also: FEC widgets and California campaign widgets). The most generic way to use the widget is without any arguments: sec_filer = sec_filed() display(sec_filer) ## # A tibble: 2,367 x 1 ## entity_id ## &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 2723 ## 2 2937 ## 3 3386 ## 4 6194 ## 5 6349 ## 6 7011 ## 7 7251 ## 8 7270 ## 9 7751 ## 10 8002 ## # … with 2,357 more rows The widget also includes the familiar from and to daterange options, so that you can search for people who made filings during a specific time period. For instance, my clients in Engineering might be interested in knowing who has made a recent filing, since these SEC filings can indicate a sudden influx of cash: engineering_prospect = in_unit_portfolio(engineering) recent_filer = sec_filed(from = 20180101, to = 20180630) prospect_who_filed = engineering_prospect %and% recent_filer display(prospect_who_filed) ## # A tibble: 31 x 1 ## entity_id ## &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 14765 ## 2 17517 ## 3 17544 ## 4 19406 ## 5 25464 ## 6 31155 ## 7 122677 ## 8 227268 ## 9 283796 ## 10 301895 ## # … with 21 more rows 22.2 Looking for companies We use the Central Index Key (CIK) to uniquely identify SEC filers and the public companies for whom they work. Looking up a CIK in the Discovery Engine uses the familiar lookup function built in to widgets: sec_filed(?google, ?facebook, ?apple) ## Regular codes and synonyms: ## synonym code ## google_inc 1288776 ## facebook_inc 1326801 ## apple_inc 320193 ## apple_inc 320193 These IDs can then be used in the sec_filed widget: display(sec_filed(1288776, 1326801, 320193)) ## # A tibble: 23 x 1 ## entity_id ## &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 22653 ## 2 26031 ## 3 26542 ## 4 423075 ## 5 423745 ## 6 453623 ## 7 611664 ## 8 625613 ## 9 666498 ## 10 769804 ## # … with 13 more rows 22.3 Specific roles The SEC filings include checkboxes for the filer to indicate which class of required filers (director, officer, ten percent owner, or other) she belongs to, and the sec_filed widget has flags so that you can specifically search for people with these roles. For instance, if in my previous example I wanted to look only for Directors at those companies, I can set director = TRUE: big_three_director = sec_filed(1288776, 1326801, 320193, director = TRUE) display(big_three_director) ## # A tibble: 16 x 1 ## entity_id ## &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 22653 ## 2 26031 ## 3 26542 ## 4 423075 ## 5 423745 ## 6 611664 ## 7 625613 ## 8 666498 ## 9 769804 ## 10 826016 ## 11 863210 ## 12 902313 ## 13 921697 ## 14 931282 ## 15 3003117 ## 16 3090604 By default, all filings are included regardless of role. Filers who check “officer” or “other” among their roles also have a free text entry space to more precisely describe their role with the company, and the sec_filed includes an option to search the text of these fields. So, for example, to find people at one of the Big Three companies who’ve described themselves as “Chairman”: sec_filed(1288776, 1326801, 320193, title_text = &quot;chairman&quot;) One practical use of the title_text argument is to identify filers who were serving on an interim basis at the time of filing: display( sec_filed(title_text = &quot;interim&quot;) ) ## # A tibble: 28 x 1 ## entity_id ## &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 15763 ## 2 31278 ## 3 232051 ## 4 258787 ## 5 268785 ## 6 291703 ## 7 330239 ## 8 333051 ## 9 348585 ## 10 382348 ## # … with 18 more rows "],
["ex-mba-dual.html", "23 Finding dual-degree holders 23.1 Why not %but_not%?", " 23 Finding dual-degree holders # i always begin by loading the disco engine if it isn&#39;t already loaded library(discoveryengine) We recently received a request to take a look at Haas MBAs who have an additional degree from Berkeley, beyond their MBA. This was a tricky one. If we wanted to find people who have a joint MBA/MPH, we could just do: has_degree(MBA) %and% has_degree(MPH) But for this request, we want to find people with an MBA plus any other degree. We want to write something like: has_degree(MBA) %and% has_degree(any_other_degree_besides_mba) How can we do that? Enter the not operator. Inside a widget, the not() operator excludes, rather than includes, the codes entered. So: mba_dual_alum = has_degree(MBA) %and% has_degree(not(MBA)) display(mba_dual_alum) ## # A tibble: 3,640 x 1 ## entity_id ## &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 137 ## 2 159 ## 3 217 ## 4 235 ## 5 252 ## 6 257 ## 7 311 ## 8 340 ## 9 358 ## 10 513 ## # … with 3,630 more rows 23.1 Why not %but_not%? You might wonder, why do we need not() when we can combine widgets with %but_not%? Our example will help illustrate the difference. This – has_degree(MBA) %but_not% has_degree(MBA) – looks for anyone who both has an MBA degree and also does not have an MBA degree. Which is impossible. What we did, on the other hand – has_degree(MBA) %and% has_degree(not(MBA)) – looks for anyone who has an MBA degree as well as a non-MBA degree.

["ex-moves-management.html", "24 Moves Management 24.1 Basics 24.2 Example: Engineering qualifications 24.3 Example: collaborative asks", " 24 Moves Management # i always begin by loading the disco engine if it isn&#39;t already loaded library(discoveryengine) The Discovery Engine provides a suite of widgets to identify proposals based on specific characteristics or events related to them. 24.1 Basics With autocomplete in mind, proposal widgets are all prefixed with proposal_. Common prefix keeps proposal widgets easy to find As with all other widgets, the proposal widgets are designed to be combined like lego blocks using %and%, %or% and %but_not% in order to precisely define solicitations (and planned solicitations) of interest. Once you’ve zeroed in on the proposals you’re interested in, you can get the relevant enitity IDs using proposal_entity, or look at related contact reports using proposal_contact. While these widgets can be used to pull the portfolio for a unit or development officer, it is simpler to use in_unit_portfolio and in_development_officer_portfolio for those needs. The proposal widgets shine in situations where you need to focus on specific types of moves and asks, as the examples below illustrate. 24.2 Example: Engineering qualifications Let’s look for prospects who were qualified by Engineering during fiscal year 2017-18: eng_qualification = proposal_office(engineering) %and% proposal_qualified(from = 20170701, to = 20180630) qualified_prospect = proposal_entity(eng_qualification) display(qualified_prospect) ## # A tibble: 233 x 1 ## entity_id ## &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 235 ## 2 1893 ## 3 3422 ## 4 6007 ## 5 6945 ## 6 7128 ## 7 14661 ## 8 16233 ## 9 17719 ## 10 21152 ## # … with 223 more rows proposal_qualified looks for proposals that moved from stage QU to one of (CU, SP, PD, GS, DS) during the specified time period (for a more flexible way to isolate specific types of moves, see ?proposal_stage_transition). So our definition describes any proposal that successfully progressed from the qualification stage, during the fiscal year, that was assigned to Engineering at the time of the stage change. Note: yes, the proposal widgets are smart enough to compare the assignment dates to the stage dates to make sure that the qualification really happened while the proposal was assigned to Engineering 24.3 Example: collaborative asks Which prospects were jointly solicited by the Library along with some other unit during fiscal year 2017-18? Let’s focus only on asks of at least $100,000. For this request, we’ll take advantage of the not() operator: joint_ask = proposal_office(library) %and% proposal_office(not(library)) %and% proposal_actual_ask(at_least = 100000, from = 20170701, to = 20180630) jointly_asked = proposal_entity(joint_ask) display(jointly_asked) ## # A tibble: 24 x 1 ## entity_id ## &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 1306 ## 2 10864 ## 3 15928 ## 4 17429 ## 5 23387 ## 6 26209 ## 7 38932 ## 8 39287 ## 9 39288 ## 10 39794 ## # … with 14 more rows "],
["test-cdw.html", "A Test your database set up A.1 Test your connection A.2 Opening RStudio A.3 Testing getcdw", " A Test your database set up A.1 Test your connection First, let’s make sure your connection works. You’ll need the user name and password you received when you got access to the data warehouse. Here are the steps to see if that connection works: Navigate to C:\\Windows\\SysWOW64. Double click odbcad32. It’s the application highlighted in the following image: You’ll now have the ODBC Data Source Administrator open. Click the “User DSN” tab and then click the “Add..” button. Scroll down to close to the bottom of the list of drivers. There you’ll find “Oracle in instantclient_12_2”. Double click this. You’ll now be in a window that asks you for some information to configure this driver. Fill out the Data Source Name as “URELUAT” and find “URELUAT” in the dropdown menu for TNS Service Name. Enter your user name (the one given to you by IST, which is probably the same as your CalNet ID) as the User ID. Click “Test Connection”. Enter your password (given to you by IST) in the Password field. Click “OK”. You should now get a pop up message letting you know that the connection was successful. Click “OK” three times to close out the ODBC Source Administrator. If you did not get this message and instead got an error message, do not continue with the rest of these instructions until your connection is successful. You may have the wrong password, or there may be other connection issues. A.2 Opening RStudio If your connection was successful, let’s move on to making sure you can connect from within RStudio – this will ensure that the Discovery Engine is able to query the data warehouse. First, open RStudio. If you don’t have an icon on your desktop, you can find the program by searching for “rstudio” in your Start menu. You’ll also find a copy at C:\\Program Files\\RStudio\\bin. If you want a shortcut on your desktop, simply drag and drop the rstudio application. When RStudio is open, you’ll see a few different panes on the screen. The console is where you can type commands and see output. We only need to worry about the console right now. It’s this part of the screen: You also want to make sure you’re using the correct version of R. Here are the steps to do so: Go to the Tools dropdown menu at the top of the screen, and select Global Options. You’ll see a box that looks like this: The top box tells you the R version you’re using. Click on the “Change..” button. Then select the option that says “Use your machine’s default version of R (32-bit).” Make sure it is 32-bit! Click “Ok” twice. You may be prompted to restart the program. If so, go ahead and do so. A.3 Testing getcdw Now we can run a test query from the data warehouse. Start by loading the library called getcdw: library(getcdw) Copy the above into your console and press enter. It will appear that nothing happened, but that actually means everything is fine. Now all we need to do is run a simple query to test the connection. We’ll do this by entering a SQL query into the console and seeing if it returns valid data (which would mean that you are able to connect to the database). When you do so, you’ll be prompted for some information, please read the instructions below and make sure you understand what you’re supposed to enter: get_cdw(&quot;select * from dual&quot;) When you do this for the first time, you will be prompted for three pieces of information: Your “UID”: This is your username to log-in to the database. Unless you were told otherwise, this should be the same as your CalNet ID. Your “PWD”: This is the password to log-in to the database. You will have received the password from IST and may be a random string of letters and numbers. Finally, you’ll be prompted for a “secret passphrase.” Instead of having you remember the password given to you by IST, getcdw allows you to pick your own secret passphrase (this can be anything, from a single word to a memorable sentence, or whatever you think is easy for you to remember but not easy for someone else to guess). After this step, you will only ever be required to enter your secret passphrase – you will no longer be prompted for your database UID or PWD. (But you can always reset them if necessary, using reset_credentials(dsn = “URELUAT”).) If everything is working properly, you should see something like this: ## # A tibble: 1 x 1 ## dummy ## &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 X If that’s what you see, you are all set! "],
["cheat-sheet.html", "B Cheat Sheet B.1 General B.2 Output B.3 Code lookup B.4 Text search B.5 Other", " B Cheat Sheet If you’re looking for help installing the discovery engine, head over to the installation guide. If you’ve previously installed the discovery engine, but need to update to the latest version, check the instructions for updating. B.1 General Always start a session with library(discoveryengine) library(discoveryengine) Use show_widgets() for help finding the right widget. When in doubt, use the brainstorm bot. For instance if you are looking for people who played on the basketball team, type brainstorm_bot(\"basketball\") Multiple widgets can be combined using the operators %and%, %or%, or %but_not%. Be aware of the add-on packages for outputting additional data and improving your disco engine experience. Use the documentation. For instance, type ?has_affiliation to understand how to use the has_affiliation widget. B.2 Output Use display for output. Recall that you can use the equals sign = to assign names to your disco engine definitions, to make it easier to refer to them when displaying or doing other operations: basketball_player = played_sport(basketball_men, basketball_women) display(basketball_player) ## # A tibble: 489 x 1 ## entity_id ## &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 370 ## 2 1495 ## 3 3615 ## 4 4425 ## 5 5946 ## 6 6412 ## 7 6882 ## 8 7539 ## 9 8283 ## 10 8328 ## # … with 479 more rows If instead of just viewing IDs on the screen, you’d like to export them (perhaps to use in a CADS savedlist), just add a filename: display(basketball_player, file = \"basketball-players\") and a file called “basketball-players.csv” will appear in your working directory. Note that the exported file has a header, so when you upload it to an Advance savedlist, make sure to check the “First row is a header” box. B.3 Code lookup Most widgets rely on the coding found in CADS for their input, but you probably haven’t memorized all of the codes! By using a question-mark inside of a widget, you can do look-ups on the fly: gave_to_department(?band) ## Regular codes and synonyms: ## synonym code ## cal_band CALBAND ## ## Defunct codes and synonyms: ## synonym code ## .cal_band BAY Codes (such as CALBAND) and synonyms (such as cal_band) can be used interchangeably, so use whichever feels more comfortable. B.4 Text search Though most widgets rely on codes from CADS as inputs, some utilize text search. Just like the brainstorm_bot, which is also based on text search, these widgets require you to use quotation marks around the search term(s). Here are some examples: contact_text_contains(\"neuro*\", \"brain\") fund_text_contains(\"diversity\") research_miner(\"underrepresented\") Note: The brainstorm_bot will help you find things through the code tables, but it will not do big text searches of things like contact reports, fund biographies/terms, and research profiles. For that kind of specialized search, you should use these text search based widgets. B.5 Other Type show_suspect_pools() to view a list of all Suspect Pools, which is useful in conjunction with the in_suspect_pool widget. "],

In this section, I’ll go over the basic building blocks that make the Disco Engine work. To help organize the lesson, I’ll assume we’re building a brand new Disco Engine from scratch. Of course, what we build will necessarily be just a simplified version of the Disco Engine, but we’ll cover the most important concepts. All of the code behind the real Disco Engine is available for anyone to view on GitHub. Where possible, I’ll add a link to the appropriate bit of production code and explain what’s different from our simplified example. C.1 A Widget as a SQL template To get data from the database, the Disco Engine converts definitions into valid SQL. The key insight here is that any first-order predicate (what’s first-order mean?) can be represented in terms of a very basic SQL query, which we can turn into this all-purpose template: select distinct ID_FIELD as ID_TYPE from TABLE_NAME where FIELD_NAME in (LIST_OF_VALUES) Note: The actual implementation allows for a broader range of queries, but this captures the basic idea. To see the actual templates used, check out the source code in the listbuilder package There are a number of R packages that allow you to be able to construct templates this way and populate them with R objects. discoveryengine uses the whisker package, but for this simplified example, I’ll use getcdw::parameterize_template: library(getcdw) generate_query &lt;- parameterize_template(&quot; select distinct ##ID_FIELD## as ##ID_TYPE## from ##TABLE_NAME## where ##FIELD_NAME## in (##LIST_OF_VALUES##) &quot;) # generate_query is now a function with the same arguments as the # names highlighted in the template generate_query ## A parameterized template with parameters: ID_FIELD, ID_TYPE, TABLE_NAME, FIELD_NAME, LIST_OF_VALUES Now, we can get a clunky, but functional, has_affiliation widget working: has_affiliation &lt;- function(affiliations) { list(ID_FIELD = &quot;entity_id&quot;, ID_TYPE = &quot;entity_id&quot;, TABLE_NAME = &quot;cdw.d_bio_affiliation_mv&quot;, FIELD_NAME = &quot;affil_code&quot;, LIST_OF_VALUES = paste0(&quot;&#39;&quot;, affiliations, &quot;&#39;&quot;, collapse = &quot;, &quot;)) } Wait, what? I wanted to create a constituency definition, but all I got was this lousy list! C.2 A template as a data structure Recall that definitions don’t turn into IDs until we use the display function. The basic job of our display function will be to take care of two steps: Convert the definition (currently just a list) to SQL, and Send the SQL to the database, returning the appropriate data So it makes sense that has_affiliation just makes a list. It has all of the components of our definition, so we can inspect and figure out what it’s supposed to return, but it won’t actually return data from the data warehouse until we build a display function. Luckily, step 2 of the display function is easy, because that’s exactly what the function getcdw::get_cdw does (if you’re building for your own database, you just need a function here that can send SQL to your database and return a data.frame). display &lt;- function(definition) { get_cdw(to_sql(definition)) } How can we implement to_sql? Well, that’s just a matter of combining our template from generate_query with the data to fill it in from has_affiliation. The R function do.call lets us call any R function using a list of arguments. For example: # here is the usual way we call a function: # this takes 2 samples from the integers between 1 and 100 sample(x = 1:100, size = 2) ## [1] 45 86 # but what if we&#39;ve collected the arguments from some process? args &lt;- list(x = 1:100, size = 2) # sample(args) won&#39;t work. what we want is do.call, which allows us to # &quot;feed&quot; args as arguments to sample() do.call(&quot;sample&quot;, args) ## [1] 41 82 Ok, so it looks like we know how to implement to_sql: to_sql &lt;- function(definition) { do.call(&quot;generate_query&quot;, definition) } That’s basically it! Let’s test what we have: is_prytanean = has_affiliation(&quot;OC6&quot;) display(is_prytanean) ## # A tibble: 3,505 x 1 ## entity_id ## &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 191395 ## 2 90351 ## 3 76997 ## 4 77877 ## 5 95676 ## 6 79147 ## 7 65981 ## 8 74960 ## 9 39317 ## 10 66507 ## # … with 3,495 more rows ## and we can use multiple affiliations: is_constituent = has_affiliation(c(&quot;M2&quot;, &quot;MA4&quot;)) display(is_constituent) ## # A tibble: 2,684 x 1 ## entity_id ## &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 810146 ## 2 80977 ## 3 66904 ## 4 129337 ## 5 259998 ## 6 261033 ## 7 265894 ## 8 234274 ## 9 215118 ## 10 236516 ## # … with 2,674 more rows Ok! So we’ve now implemented basic widget functionality. We still have a couple of outstanding issues: The real disco engine allows you to type has_affiliation(M2, MA4) which is so much more readable and easy-to-understand than has_affiliation(c(\"M2\", \"MA4\")). How can we combine multiple predicates to make complex definitions? C.3 Non-standard evaluation The answer to our first outstanding issue is provided by the magic of non-standard evaluation (that link is to the Non-standard evaluation chapter of the excellent book Advanced R by Hadley Wickham, which I highly recommend). For the purposes of this simplified example, I’ll use the following: has_affiliation &lt;- function(...) { affiliations &lt;- eval(substitute(alist(...))) affiliations &lt;- as.character(affiliations) list(ID_FIELD = &quot;entity_id&quot;, ID_TYPE = &quot;entity_id&quot;, TABLE_NAME = &quot;cdw.d_bio_affiliation_mv&quot;, FIELD_NAME = &quot;affil_code&quot;, LIST_OF_VALUES = paste0(&quot;&#39;&quot;, affiliations, &quot;&#39;&quot;, collapse = &quot;, &quot;)) } Here eval(substitute(alist(...))) and as.character(affiliations) take the symbols entered by the user (I’m noting they are symbols and not characters) and convert them to a character vector. So far, so good: display( has_affiliation(M2, MA4) ) ## # A tibble: 2,684 x 1 ## entity_id ## &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 810146 ## 2 80977 ## 3 66904 ## 4 129337 ## 5 259998 ## 6 261033 ## 7 265894 ## 8 234274 ## 9 215118 ## 10 236516 ## # … with 2,674 more rows Note that the actual package is a little bit more careful about how it does things here, by using the lazyeval package. To see the actual code used in the Disco Engine, check out prep_dots and partial_sub in this discoveryengine source code file C.4 Combining simple definitions Now we want to know, given two existing definitions, how do we combine them into one more complex definition? The answer is surprisingly simple, but may take a minute to wrap your head around if you haven’t programmed in this way before. I’ll take things step-by-step. C.4.1 “Atomic” vs. “Complex” definitions Our first step is to distinguish between what I’ll call “atomic” and “complex” definitions. So far we’ve been working with atomic definitions – that is, simple definitions that do not use %and%, %or%, or %but_not%. Since we’ll want to build more widgets (in order to benefit from being able to combine them!), I’m going to write some scaffolding code that will make it easier to produce widgets: # widget will be a function to make ATOMIC definitions widget &lt;- function(..., ID_FIELD, ID_TYPE = ID_FIELD, TABLE_NAME, FIELD_NAME) { args &lt;- eval(substitute(alist(...))) args &lt;- as.character(args) res &lt;- list(ID_FIELD = ID_FIELD, ID_TYPE = ID_TYPE, TABLE_NAME = TABLE_NAME, FIELD_NAME = FIELD_NAME, LIST_OF_VALUES = paste0(&quot;&#39;&quot;, args, &quot;&#39;&quot;, collapse = &quot;, &quot;)) # tagging atomic definitions makes it easier to keep track # here we add an &quot;attribute&quot; specifying that the definition is atomic # if you&#39;re unfamiliar with attributes, see ?attributes structure(res, atomic = TRUE) } Now let’s re-create has_affiliation using our new scaffolding code, and also let’s create a widget called participated_in for student activities and one called on_committee for committee participation: has_affiliation &lt;- function(...) { # notice I can just pass the ... along to the next function widget(..., ID_FIELD = &quot;entity_id&quot;, TABLE_NAME = &quot;cdw.d_bio_affiliation_mv&quot;, FIELD_NAME = &quot;affil_code&quot;) } participated_in &lt;- function(...) { widget(..., ID_FIELD = &quot;entity_id&quot;, TABLE_NAME = &quot;cdw.d_bio_student_activity_mv&quot;, FIELD_NAME = &quot;student_activity_code&quot;) } on_committee &lt;- function(...) { widget(..., ID_FIELD = &quot;entity_id&quot;, TABLE_NAME = &quot;cdw.d_bio_committee_mv&quot;, FIELD_NAME = &quot;committee_code&quot;) } Just to make sure I haven’t broken anything, I quickly inspect the SQL that is being built by these widgets: # to make it easier to inspect the queries show_query &lt;- function(definition) cat(to_sql(definition)) show_query( has_affiliation(MA6, OC3) ) ## ## select distinct entity_id as entity_id ## from cdw.d_bio_affiliation_mv ## where affil_code in (&#39;MA6&#39;, &#39;OC3&#39;) show_query( participated_in(SA1, SA2) ) ## ## select distinct entity_id as entity_id ## from cdw.d_bio_student_activity_mv ## where student_activity_code in (&#39;SA1&#39;, &#39;SA2&#39;) show_query( on_committee(AE7, ME3, ME5, AE5) ) ## ## select distinct entity_id as entity_id ## from cdw.d_bio_committee_mv ## where committee_code in (&#39;AE7&#39;, &#39;ME3&#39;, &#39;ME5&#39;, &#39;AE5&#39;) C.4.2 Operations on definitions We now want to implement %and%, %or%, and %but_not%. Luckily, these are closely related to, in order, the SQL operators intersect, union, and minus. So here is the surprisingly simple template we need to construct complex queries: generate_complex_query &lt;- parameterize_template(&quot; (##LHS##) ##operator## (##RHS##) &quot;) Here LHS and RHS (which stand for “left-hand-side” and “right-hand-side”) are the SQL translations of definitions (they can be atomic or complex – as long as we know they have been converted to SQL properly, the result of this template will also be a valid SQL query). So when we translate a complex definition to SQL, all we have to do is translate the individual components to SQL. Those components (that is, LHS and RHS) may be either atomic (in which case we already know what to do) or complex (in which case we’ll just break it down again using the same logic, until we get down to atomic definitions). Now to implement our operations, we once again collect the necessary information into a list, this time tagging it as not atomic: operate &lt;- function(LHS, RHS, operator) { res &lt;- list( operator = operator, LHS = LHS, RHS = RHS ) # we need to make sure to tag the result as NOT atomic structure(res, atomic = FALSE) } `%and%` &lt;- function(LHS, RHS) operate(LHS, RHS, &quot;intersect&quot;) `%or%` &lt;- function(LHS, RHS) operate(LHS, RHS, &quot;union&quot;) `%but_not%` &lt;- function(LHS, RHS) operate(LHS, RHS, &quot;minus&quot;) C.5 Re-visiting to_sql We now have two different SQL templates – one for atomic definitions, and one for non-atomic definitions. Accordingly, we’ll update to_sql so that it uses the correct template. The fact that every definition we create, whether atomic or not, has an attribute called atomic that can be either TRUE or FALSE helps us. We’ll start by making a helper function that tells us if a definition is complex or not: is_atomic &lt;- function(definition) { # recall this attribute is always TRUE or FALSE attr(definition, &quot;atomic&quot;) } Now we can update our to_sql function to check whether a definition is atomic or not and then populate the appropriate template: to_sql &lt;- function(definition) { # we already know what to do with atomic definitions if (is_atomic(definition)) do.call(&quot;generate_query&quot;, definition) # with complex definitions, we translate the LHS and RHS to SQL, # then pass everything back to the complex query template else { translated_pieces &lt;- list( LHS = to_sql(definition$LHS), RHS = to_sql(definition$RHS), operator = definition$operator ) do.call(&quot;generate_complex_query&quot;, translated_pieces) } } If you look closely at the non-atomic part of to_sql, you may be surprised to find that it seems to be circularly defined! It helps to describe the process in plain language first: To convert a complex (i.e. non-atomic) definition to SQL, we first convert its constituent pieces to SQL, then combine the resulting SQL using the appropriate operator (intersect, union, or minus) That process is pretty easy to understand if both pieces of a non-atomic definition are atomic, but what if, say, the left-hand-side (LHS) is also non-atomic? Well, we just do the same thing, trying to convert the constituent pieces to SQL, and so forth. This works because we know that eventually we’ll hit an atomic definition. C.6 Seeing it all in action Let’s create some definitions and then see how they are being converted to SQL. # a simple definition has_engineering_affil = has_affiliation(MA4, SWE, URAE, DEN1) # a slightly more complex definition engineering_constituency_1 = has_engineering_affil %and% participated_in(UWSE, CHES, ENWE, ENSE) engineering_constituency_2 = engineering_constituency_1 %but_not% on_committee(ME3) To reassure myself that the system is working as expected, I display the most complicated constituency, and look in CADS to verify that the resulting IDs do in fact match the definition I created: display(engineering_constituency_2) ## # A tibble: 9 x 1 ## entity_id ## &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 593821 ## 2 664489 ## 3 819567 ## 4 838088 ## 5 3363382 ## 6 3365316 ## 7 3365456 ## 8 3368294 ## 9 3368344 Now, let’s take a look at the actual SQL that is being generated behind the scenes: # we&#39;ve already seen the atomic definitions turned to SQL: show_query(has_engineering_affil) ## ## select distinct entity_id as entity_id ## from cdw.d_bio_affiliation_mv ## where affil_code in (&#39;MA4&#39;, &#39;SWE&#39;, &#39;URAE&#39;, &#39;DEN1&#39;) # this is a complex definition, but both pieces are atomic: show_query(engineering_constituency_1) ## ## ( ## select distinct entity_id as entity_id ## from cdw.d_bio_affiliation_mv ## where affil_code in (&#39;MA4&#39;, &#39;SWE&#39;, &#39;URAE&#39;, &#39;DEN1&#39;) ## ) ## intersect ## ( ## select distinct entity_id as entity_id ## from cdw.d_bio_student_activity_mv ## where student_activity_code in (&#39;UWSE&#39;, &#39;CHES&#39;, &#39;ENWE&#39;, &#39;ENSE&#39;) ## ) # as the definitions get more complex, even the LHS and RHS can # be complex, but everything still can be analyzed down to atomic pieces: show_query(engineering_constituency_2) ## ## ( ## ( ## select distinct entity_id as entity_id ## from cdw.d_bio_affiliation_mv ## where affil_code in (&#39;MA4&#39;, &#39;SWE&#39;, &#39;URAE&#39;, &#39;DEN1&#39;) ## ) ## intersect ## ( ## select distinct entity_id as entity_id ## from cdw.d_bio_student_activity_mv ## where student_activity_code in (&#39;UWSE&#39;, &#39;CHES&#39;, &#39;ENWE&#39;, &#39;ENSE&#39;) ## ) ## ) ## minus ## ( ## select distinct entity_id as entity_id ## from cdw.d_bio_committee_mv ## where committee_code in (&#39;ME3&#39;) ## ) You’ll notice that, especially as the definitions grow more complex, the resulting SQL may not look exactly how you’d type it yourself. But it does work, is correct, and thanks to the Relational Algebra, I know the SQL will be optimized before running against our data. C.7 For further study If you’ve made it this far, you should have a pretty solid understanding of the basic functioning of the Discovery Engine. We did not cover some core features, in particular code lookup (aka synonym search), higher order widgets, and the bots – the brainstorm bot and the matrix bot. But armed with the knowledge you do have, you can explore the source code and see how everything else works. Feel free to reach out to Caleb via email if you have any questions. "]

And in order to successfully install the discoveryengine, you’ll have to install a few other packages, too. The video in section @ref(r_intro) showed you how to install new packages both by typing install commands into the console, or by using RStudio’s “Packages” pane. Here, we’ll go through the installation step-by-step by typing out the install commands (copying and pasting is a good way to avoid frustrating typos!). Note that installation can sometimes be a pain. But once you’ve gotten through the process successfully, you won’t have to deal with it again! 4.1 Required packages At this point, you should have already: - tested your CDW connection - installed getcdw - run a test query If you haven’t completed all of those items, head over to section @ref(test_cdw) and complete those steps, and then return here. Ok, so if you’ve got getcdw working properly, that means you’ve already installed devtools. All that’s left is to install listbuilder and discoveryengine packages: devtools::install_github(&quot;cwolfsonseeley/listbuilder&quot;) devtools::install_github(&quot;cwolfsonseeley/discoveryengine&quot;) 4.2 A disco test In order to make sure everything is working properly, we’ll run a quick disco test: # you&#39;ll always load the discoveryengine package before doing anythying else library(discoveryengine) ## Welcome to Disco Engine version 0.4.1 ## Cheat sheet: https://cwolfsonseeley.github.io/discodocs/cheat-sheet.html ## News and bugfixes: https://github.com/cwolfsonseeley/discoveryengine/blob/master/NEWS.md # make sure we can create a disco definition high_cap = has_capacity(1) # make sure that things print properly high_cap ## LISTBUILDER DEFINITION (type: entity_id) ## . source: d_entity_mv.entity_id (entity_id) ## . logic: capacity_rating_code IN (1) # make sure we can send the defintion to the data warehouse display(high_cap) ## # A tibble: 265 x 1 ## entity_id ## &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 1969 ## 2 3105 ## 3 3422 ## 4 7011 ## 5 7644 ## 6 12178 ## 7 12453 ## 8 13305 ## 9 17464 ## 10 18139 ## # ... with 255 more rows If you got this far without any problems, then congrats!

Now that we have things set up, we can start playing around with the `discoveryengine`. We start by loading the package.

```{r}

```

Let's see what happens when we use the `has_capacity` widget, with a capacity rating of 1 ($100 Million+):

```{r}

```

Every time you use a widget, you create a *definition*. When you use the discoveryengine, you create a prospect list by defining its members. In this case, we've defined the list of individuals who have a capacity of 1 ($100 Million+), and that is what the above definition represents.

```{r}
has_capacity(1) %or% has_implied_capacity(most_likely)
```

Of course, our interest is in

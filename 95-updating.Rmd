# Updating your installation {#updating}

## When do I need to update the Disco Engine?

We are always working on and improving the Disco Engine, incorporating feedback and adding new features. But you shouldn't feel pressure to be constantly updating your version of the Disco Engine - most updates incorporate new features without disrupting any existing functionality. So when should you update?

1. If a significant bug was discovered and fixed. Tarak will send out an email if this happens.
2. If a new version includes significantly new functionality, you'll want to update to take advantage of the new features. Tarak will send out an email if this is the case, and there will also be a demonstration of the new features in a staff meeting. 
3. If you're trying to use a widget you heard about, but you get an error, that's probably because the widget was added since your last update. 

That said, it doesn't take much time to update the Disco Engine (see below for instructions), and updates will never change existing functionality, so feel free to update more frequently if you wish. In fact, if you try to update but you're already on the latest version, you'll get a message informing you of the fact, and no updates will happen. There is no penalty or cost for trying to update the Disco Engine.

## What version am I using right now?

Whenever you start up the Disco Engine, there is a welcome message that will tell you what version number you currently have installed:

## What's the most recent version?

The welcome message above includes a link to the Disco Engine [NEWS page](https://github.com/tarakc02/discoveryengine/blob/master/NEWS.md), which not only shows what the most recent version number is, but also goes over all of the changes made in each version. 

## How do I update?

We've found that updating goes most smoothly when you start with a fresh R session. So if you already have RStudio open, press Ctrl+Shift+F10 (or use the menu and navigate to Session | Restart R). This will restart R without restarting RStudio. Next, just type:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("tarakc02/discoveryengine")
```

That should do it! The `devtools` package that is used to do the installation is smart enough to make any other necessary updates to other packages that `discoveryengine` depends on, so typing that one line might result in updates to several packages. 

When you do that, one of these things will happen:

1. You see a message that starts with "Skipping install of 'discoveryengine' from a github remote . . .": That just means you're already up-to-date and don't need to do anything more.
2. A bunch of text scrolls up the screen, ending with "* DONE (discoveryengine)". Congrats! You've successfully updated your Disco Engine installation!
3. Something else: uh oh - something might have gone wrong. Get in touch with Tarak or Caleb to help troubleshoot.

The Discovery Engine provides a suite of widgets to identify proposals based on specific characteristics or events related to them. 

## Basics

With [autocomplete in mind](#working-with-autocomplete), proposal widgets are all prefixed with `proposal_`. 

![Common prefix keeps proposal widgets easy to find](images/proposal-autocomplete.png)

As with all other widgets, the proposal widgets are designed to be combined like lego blocks using `%and%`, `%or%` and `%but_not%` in order to precisely define solicitations (and planned solicitations) of interest. Once you've zeroed in on the proposals you're interested in, you can get the relevant enitity IDs using `proposal_entity`, or look at related contact reports using `proposal_contact`.

While these widgets can be used to pull the portfolio for a unit or development officer, it is simpler to use `in_unit_portfolio` and `in_development_officer_portfolio` for those needs. The proposal widgets shine in situations where you need to focus on specific types of moves and asks, as the examples below illustrate.

## Example: Engineering qualifications

Let's look for prospects who were qualified by Engineering during fiscal year 2017-18:

```{r mm-eng-qualifications, cache = TRUE}
eng_qualification = proposal_office(engineering) %and%
    proposal_qualified(from = 20170701, to = 20180630)

qualified_prospect = proposal_entity(eng_qualification)
display(qualified_prospect)
```

`proposal_qualified` looks for proposals that moved from stage `QU` to one of `(CU, SP, PD, GS, DS)` during the specified time period (for a more flexible way to isolate specific types of moves, see `?proposal_stage_transition`). So our definition describes any proposal that successfully progressed from the qualification stage, during the fiscal year, that was assigned to Engineering at the time of the stage change.

*Note: yes, the proposal widgets are smart enough to compare the assignment dates to the stage dates to make sure that the qualification really happened while the proposal was assigned to Engineering*

## Example: collaborative asks

Which prospects were jointly solicited by the Library along with some other unit during fiscal year 2017-18? Let's focus only on asks of at least $100,000. For this request, we'll take advantage of the [`not()` operator](#widget-not-operator):

```{r mm-lib-joint-solicit, cache = TRUE}
joint_ask = proposal_office(library) %and%
    proposal_office(not(library)) %and%
    proposal_actual_ask(at_least = 100000, 
                        from = 20170701, to = 20180630)

jointly_asked = proposal_entity(joint_ask)
display(jointly_asked)
```
